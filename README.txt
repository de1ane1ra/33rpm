33rpm is a space on the web displaying album cover concepts designed by deianeira.

It intends to display thousands of high resolution images, utilize minimal bandwidth and energy, and provide a compelling and effortless viewing experience.

It attempts to achieve this without the necessity of any client-side javascript.

33rpm is currently in active development. Experiments in dithering, image compression, and pagination to come.
